	abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along ‘desire lines’ of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question ‘where to build?’. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool ({PCT}) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based ‘cycling futures.’ Four scenarios are presented, including ‘Go Dutch’ and ‘Ebikes,’ which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The {PCT} reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The {PCT} is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the {PCT} illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

Shared bicycle systems have been adopted by a growing number of cities and regions throughout the world, yet little is known about the users of the systems and their motivations. A survey was conducted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2010 to determine the factors that encouraged individuals to use the system and the elements that influenced frequency of use. The factor found to have the greatest effect on the likelihood for use of a shared bicycle system was the proximity of home to docking stations. Ownership of a yearly shared bicycle membership was associated with cyclists riding shared bicycles 15 additional times per year. Respondents indicated that they valued the shared bicycle's trendy status and the role that it could play in bicycle theft prevention. The potential of shared bicycle systems can be maximized by increasing the number of docking stations in residential neighborhoods and by emphasizing the popularity of shared bicycles and theft prevention in advertising campaigns.},

	abstract = {Background
Cycling contributes to physical activity and health. Public bicycle share programs ({PBSPs}) increase population access to bicycles by deploying bicycles at docking stations throughout a city. Minimal research has systematically examined the prevalence and correlates of {PBSP} use.
Purpose
To determine the prevalence and correlates of use of a new public bicycle share program called {BIXI} (name merges the word {BIcycle} and {taXI}) implemented in May 2009 in Montreal, Canada.
Methods
A total of 2502 adults were recruited to a telephone survey in autumn 2009 via random-digit dialing according to a stratified random sampling design. The prevalence of {BIXI} bicycle use was estimated. Multivariate logistic regression allowed for identification of correlates of use. Data analysis was conducted in spring and summer 2010.
Results
The unweighted mean age of respondents was 47.4 ({SD}=16.8) years and 61.4\% were female. The weighted prevalence for use of {BIXI} bicycles at least once was 8.2\%. Significant correlates of {BIXI} bicycle use were having a {BIXI} docking station within 250 m of home, being aged 18–24 years, being university educated, being on work leave, and using cycling as the primary mode of transportation to work.
Conclusions
A newly implemented public bicycle share program attracts a substantial fraction of the population and is more likely to attract younger and more educated people who currently use cycling as a primary transportation mode.},

Greater {PBSP} use promotes health benefits through increased physical activity yet financial costs and distant location of docking stations are barriers to {PBSP} uptake and reach of health promoting amenities is poorer among lesser educated individuals. However, lack of awareness of {PBSP} is the first barrier to overcome. This study examined 2-year changes in lack of awareness of a transport-related innovation implemented in Spring 2009 in Montreal, Canada, namely a {PBSP} called {BIXI}© as a function of proximity to bicycle docking stations and educational attainment As part of a larger investigation, a repeated cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 7011 adults was recruited through random-digit dialling to landline telephones in three population surveys: prior to implementation (n=2000), after season 1 (n=2502), and after season 2 (n=2509). Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations of survey periods, proximity to docking stations, and education with lack of awareness while controlling for socio-demographic and health characteristics. At baseline, lower education and absence of docking stations within walking distance were associated with lower likelihood of awareness of the {PBSP}. There was a greater likelihood of being {PBSP}-unaware among those with lower education after season 1 implementation in comparison to those with higher education ({OR}=1.60, 95\%{CI}: 1.18, 2.19). Those with lower education after season 2 implementation in neighbourhoods where {PBSP} was available were more likely to be {PBSP}-unaware in comparison to those with higher education in neighbourhoods without {PBSP} docking stations ({OR}=1.63, 95\%{CI}: 1.01, 2.64). Although lack of awareness decreased over time, greater percentages of being {PBSP}-unaware were observed among those with lower education and living in neighbourhoods both with and without {PBSP} docking stations. Despite accessibility of the {PBSP} docking stations in neighbourhoods, inequalities in awareness persist.},

Although cycling is an option for many commuters, a considerable number of them choose to use other forms of transport. In order to underpin policies that promote commuting by bicycle, this paper investigates the determinants for commuting to work. As many bicycle commuters do not cycle every day, we also examine people's daily choices, in terms of frequency. We conducted a survey of the current literature in order to identify the determinants for commuting by bicycle. We found many determinants, not all of which are addressed by conventional mode choice studies and models. This suggests that predicting and influencing bicycle use needs to be grounded in other kinds of knowledge than those currently available for motorized forms of transport.},

	abstract = {Background
Mechanisms linking changes to the environment with changes in physical activity are poorly understood. Insights into mechanisms of interventions can help strengthen causal attribution and improve understanding of divergent response patterns. We examined the causal pathways linking exposure to new transport infrastructure with changes in cycling to work.
Methods
We used baseline (2009) and follow-up (2012) data (N = 469) from the Commuting and Health in Cambridge natural experimental study (Cambridge, {UK}). Exposure to new infrastructure in the form of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway was defined using residential proximity. Mediators studied were changes in perceptions of the route to work, theory of planned behaviour constructs and self-reported use of the new infrastructure. Outcomes were modelled as an increase, decrease or no change in weekly cycle commuting time. We used regression analyses to identify combinations of mediators forming potential pathways between exposure and outcome. We then tested these pathways in a path model and stratified analyses by baseline level of active commuting.
Results
We identified changes in perceptions of the route to work, and use of the cycle path, as potential mediators. Of these potential mediators, only use of the path significantly explained (85\%) the effect of the infrastructure in increasing cycling. Path use also explained a decrease in cycling among more active commuters.
Conclusion
The findings strengthen the causal argument that changing the environment led to changes in health-related behaviour via use of the new infrastructure, but also show how some commuters may have spent less time cycling as a result.},

Lines embedded in geographic space have commonly been used in mapping transport flows, especially when geographic patterns are important, as they are when characterizing cities or managing transportation. For larger numbers of flows, however, this approach requires careful design to avoid problems of occlusion, salience bias, and information overload. Driven by the requirements identified by users and managers of the London Bicycle Hire scheme, we present three methods of representation of bicycle-hire use and travel patterns. Flow maps with curved flow symbols are used to show overviews in flow structures. Gridded views of docking-station locations that preserve geographic relationships are used to explore docking-station status over space and time in a graphically efficient manner. Origin?Destination maps that visualize the {OD} matrix directly while maintaining geographic context are used to provide visual details on demand. We use these approaches to identify changes in travel behaviour over space and time, to aid station rebalancing, and to provide a framework for incorporating travel modelling and simulation.},

	abstract = {Transport and public health researchers have a shared interest in the promotion of active travel. Walking and cycling are activities that may help to achieve health benefits while also contributing to wider sustainability goals, such as a reduction in carbon emissions from transport, improvements in air quality, and reduced congestion. A variety of interventions have been used to promote travel behaviour change, for example, infrastructure change and personalised travel planning. Some researchers have directed their interest towards the potential of technology and visual representation to motivate and engage individuals to increase their sustainability practices. Computer visualisation tools may be an instrument to prompt behaviour change, leading to a shift towards more active modes of travel. Visualisation technology has been used for many purposes, including raising awareness of global environmental problems, scenario modelling, and the representation of walking and cycling futures. Recently, the availability of large datasets has led to the visualisation of system-usage data from cycle-hire schemes. Elsewhere, various representations of personal journey data have been evaluated in terms of their capabilities to change behaviour. Currently, it is thought that the technical possibilities of visualisations exceed the knowledge of their correct application. Therefore, methods and guidelines for producing and applying visualisations are required. To our knowledge there has been no evaluation of the use of a visualisation that shows infrastructure change to promote active travel. In this study participants were asked to watch a computer visualisation of a new walking and cycling route in Glasgow. This animated visualisation included an existing segregated cycling facility and pedestrian and cyclist bridge. Eleven semistructured interviews and two focus groups considered the potential utility of visualisation in promoting a new walking and cycling facility and identified any limitations of this approach and potential improvements. The results suggested that visualisation technology has the potential to stimulate debate on in-journey accounts of active travel and the embodied experience of cycling. The built environment and psychosocial factors that culminate in road-user conflicts were discussed. The perception of nonmotorised modes of transport as risky was not overlooked by participants, who shared their knowledge of cycling road safety and ‘correct’ walking and cycling behaviours. Participants responded positively to the appearance of protection from traffic achieved by the new routes. However, many criticised the limited coverage of the visualisation and low traffic volumes. The decision to cycle is often made in the context of real-life constraints that were not replicated fully in this visualisation. Further development of visualisation technology may be needed before it can be used successfully for active travel interventions. © 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

	abstract = {Public bicycle and car sharing schemes have proliferated in recent years and are increasingly part of the urban transport landscape. Shared transport options have the potential to support social inclusion by improving accessibility: these initiatives could remove some of the barriers to car ownership or bicycle usage such as upfront costs, maintenance and storage. However, the existing evidence base indicates that, in reality, users are most likely to be white, male and middle class. This paper argues that there is a need to consider the social inclusivity of sharing schemes and to develop appropriate evaluation frameworks accordingly. We therefore open by considering ways in which shared transport schemes might be inclusive or not, using a framework developed from accessibility planning. In the second part of the paper, we use the case study of Glasgow in Scotland to undertake a spatial equity analysis of such schemes. We examine how well they serve different population groups across the city, using the locations of bicycle stations and car club parking spaces in Glasgow, comparing and contrasting bike and car. An apparent failure to deliver benefits across the demographic spectrum raises important questions about the socially inclusive nature of public investment in similar schemes.},

This synthesis represents a critically needed evaluation of the current state of global bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather than the car.},

Purported benefits of bike share include flexible mobility, physical activity, reduced congestion, emissions and fuel use. Implicit or explicit in the calculation of program benefits are assumptions regarding the modes of travel replaced by bike share journeys. This paper examines the degree to which car trips are replaced by bike share, through an examination of survey and trip data from bike share programs in Melbourne, Brisbane, Washington, D.C., London, and Minneapolis/St. Paul.

A secondary and unique component of this analysis examines motor vehicle support services required for bike share fleet rebalancing and maintenance. These two components are then combined to estimate bike share’s overall contribution to changes in vehicle kilometers traveled.

The results indicate an estimated reduction in motor vehicle use due to bike share of approx. 90,000 km per annum in Melbourne and Minneapolis/St. Paul and 243,291 km for Washington, D.C. London’s bike share program however recorded an additional 766,341 km in motor vehicle use. This was largely due to a low car mode substitution rate and substantial truck use for rebalancing of bicycles. As bike share programs mature, evaluation of their effectiveness in reducing car use may become increasingly important. Researchers can adapt the analytical approach proposed in this paper to assist in the evaluation of current and future bike share programs.},

	abstract = {Objective To model the impacts of the bicycle sharing system in London on the health of its users.
Design Health impact modelling and evaluation, using a stochastic simulation model.
Setting Central and inner London, England.
Data sources Total population operational registration and usage data for the London cycle hire scheme (collected April 2011-March 2012), surveys of cycle hire users (collected 2011), and London data on travel, physical activity, road traffic collisions, and particulate air pollution ({PM}2.5, (collected 2005-12).
Participants 578 607 users of the London cycle hire scheme, aged 14 years and over, with an estimated 78\% of travel time accounted for by users younger than 45 years.
Main outcome measures Change in lifelong disability adjusted life years ({DALYs}) based on one year impacts on incidence of disease and injury, modelled through medium term changes in physical activity, road traffic injuries, and exposure to air pollution.
Results Over the year examined the users made 7.4 million cycle hire trips (estimated 71\% of cycling time by men). These trips would mostly otherwise have been made on foot (31\%) or by public transport (47\%). To date there has been a trend towards fewer fatalities and injuries than expected on cycle hire bicycles. Using these observed injury rates, the population benefits from the cycle hire scheme substantially outweighed harms (net change −72 {DALYs} (95\% credible interval −110 to −43) among men using cycle hire per accounting year; −15 (−42 to −6) among women; note that negative {DALYs} represent a health benefit). When we modelled cycle hire injury rates as being equal to background rates for all cycling in central London, these benefits were smaller and there was no evidence of a benefit among women (change −49 {DALYs} (−88 to −17) among men; −1 {DALY} (−27 to 12) among women). This sex difference largely reflected higher road collision fatality rates for female cyclists. At older ages the modelled benefits of cycling were much larger than the harms. Using background injury rates in the youngest age group (15 to 29 years), the medium term benefits and harms were both comparatively small and potentially negative.
Conclusion London’s bicycle sharing system has positive health impacts overall, but these benefits are clearer for men than for women and for older users than for younger users. The potential benefits of cycling may not currently apply to all groups in all settings.},

In the {UK}, men are twice as likely as women to cycle to work and cycling tends to be dominated by younger adults. By contrast, in higher cycling countries and cities, gender differences are low, absent, or in the opposite direction. Such places also lack the {UK}'s steady decline in cycling among those aged over 35 years. Over the past fifteen years some {UK} local areas have seen increases in cycling. This paper analyses data from the English and Welsh Census 2001 and 2011 to examine whether such increases are associated with greater diversity among cyclists. We find that in areas where cycling has increased, there has been no increase in the representation of females, and a decrease in the representation of older adults. We discuss potential causes and policy implications. Importantly, simply increasing cycling modal share has not proved sufficient to create an inclusive cycling culture. The {UK}'s culturally specific factors limiting female take-up of cycling seem to remain in place, even where cycling has gone up. Creating a mass cycling culture may require deliberately targeting infrastructure and policies towards currently under-represented groups.},

Several themes have begun to emerge from studies examining bikeshare. Convenience is the major motivator for bikeshare use. Financial savings has been found to motivate those on a low income and the distance one lives from a docking station is an important predictor for bikeshare membership. In a range of countries, it has been found that just under 50\% of bikeshare members use the system less than once a month. Men use bikeshare more than women, but the imbalance is not as dramatic as private bike riding (at least in low cycling countries). Commuting is the most common trip purpose for annual members. Users are less likely than private cyclists to wear helmets, but in countries with mandatory helmet legislation, usage levels have suffered. Bikeshare users appear less likely to be injured than private bike riders. Future directions include integration with ebikes, {GPS} (global positioning system), dockless systems and improved public transport integration. Greater research is required to quantify the impacts of bikeshare, in terms of mode choice, emissions, congestion and health.},

Following the launch of the London bicycle sharing system ({LBSS}) in 2010, women and residents of deprived areas were under-represented among initial users. This paper examines how the profile of users has changed across the scheme’s first 3 years, using total-population registration and usage data. We find that women still make fewer than 20\% of all ‘registered-use’ {LBSS} trips, although evidence from elsewhere suggests that the introduction of ‘casual’ use has encouraged a higher overall female share of trips. The proportion of trips by registered users from ‘highly-deprived areas’ (in the top tenth nationally for income deprivation) rose from 6\% to 12\%. This was due not only to the 2012 {LBSS} extension to some of London’s poorest areas, but also to a steadily increasing share of trips by residents of highly-deprived areas in the original {LBSS} zone. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that the twofold increase in {LBSS} prices in January 2013 has disproportionately discouraged casual-use trips among residents of poorer areas. We conclude that residents in deprived areas can and do use bicycle sharing systems if these are built in their local areas, and may do so progressively more over time, but only if the schemes remain affordable relative to other modes.},

	abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: Cycling confers individual and population-level health benefits, but uptake is not always equitable across socio-demographic groups. We sought to examine inequalities in uptake and usage of London's Barclays Cycle Hire ({BCH}) scheme. Method: We obtained complete {BCH} registration data, and compared users with the general population. We examined usage levels by explanatory variables including gender, small-area income-deprivation and local cycling prevalence. Results: 100,801 registered individuals made 2.5 million trips between July 2010 and March 2011. Compared with residents and workers in the central London area served by the scheme, registered individuals were more likely to be male and to live in areas of low deprivation and high cycling prevalence. Among those registered, females made 1.63 (95\%{CI} 1.53, 1.74) fewer trips per month than males, and made under a fifth of all trips. Adjusting for the fact that deprived areas were less likely to be close to {BCH} docking stations, users in the most deprived areas made 0.85 (95\%{CI} 0.63,1.07) more trips per month than those in the least deprived areas. Conclusion: Females and residents in deprived areas are underrepresented among users of London's public bicycle sharing scheme. The scheme's planned expansion into more deprived areas has, however, the potential to create a more equitable uptake of cycling. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

A significant effect of the public bicycle share program was observed on intention (exposure × time; odds ratio = 3.41; 95\% confidence interval: 1.50–7.73) and self-efficacy (exposure; odds ratio = 1.61; 95\% confidence interval: 1.28–2.01). A positive effect on intention was observed among individuals with low income (exposure × time; odds ratio = 27.85; 95\% confidence interval: 2.51–309.25). Implementing a public bicycle share program is associated with increases in intention and self-efficacy for public bicycle share use, although some social inequalities persist.},

	abstract = {Bicycle share systems are becoming an increasingly popular feature of many urban areas across the United States. While these systems aim to increase transit mode options as well as overall bicycle ridership, bike share programs also face challenges and criticisms related to density and inequitable distribution of services. Key factors in the success of bicycle share include high station density as well as services that reach a variety of neighborhoods, though many current systems do not reach low-income areas. Equitable station distribution therefore appears to be a complex problem to address. We propose utilizing spatial analytics, including {GIS} and spatial optimization, to help site bicycle share stations across an urban region. Speciﬁcally we seek to apply a covering model to assess how many bicycle stations are needed, and where they should be located, so no user would have to travel too far for access. The city of Phoenix, Arizona, is used as a case study to illustrate the coverage and access tradeoﬀs possible through diﬀerent investment strategies. Accordingly, for a given investment level, the set of stations is identiﬁed that provides the best access to the designated bike path network for the greatest number of potential users. Further, tradeoﬀ options that diﬀerentially favor either network or population coverage are possible, and can be identiﬁed and evaluated through the proposed analytical framework.},

But is it really possible that politicians, information-technology companies, and global players such as banks and advertising ﬁrms have suddenly joined the ranks of those advocating bicycle use for the sake of the environment and a better quality of life in cities? Bike-share systems, like any other artifact, are a technological assemblage formed by technical, cultural, economic, and social factors and actors. When this assemblage stabilizes and is socially accepted, debate cools down and some unresolved features are put aside. We argue that disassembly of the bike-share system, highlighting the use of electronic keys, credit cards, and the strategic location of docks in upmarket urban areas, may enable us to unveil some of its features and reveal a more complex sociotechnical assemblage.},

	abstract = {Despite the popularity of bike sharing, there is a lack of evidence on existing schemes and whether they achieved their objectives. This paper is concerned with identifying and critically interpreting the available evidence on bike sharing to date, on both impacts and processes of implementation and operation. The existing evidence suggests that bike sharing can increase cycling levels but needs complementary pro-cycling measures and wider support to sustainable urban mobility to thrive. Whilst predominantly enabling commuting, bike sharing allows users to undertake other key economic, social and leisure activities. Beneﬁts include improved health, increased transport choice and convenience, reduced travel times and costs, and improved travel experience. These beneﬁts are unequally distributed, since users are typically male, younger and in more advantaged socio-economic positions than average. There is no evidence that bike sharing signiﬁcantly reduces trafﬁc congestion, carbon emissions and pollution. From a process perspective, bike sharing can be delivered through multiple governance models. A key challenge to operation is network rebalancing, while facilitating factors include partnership working and inclusive scheme promotion. The paper suggests directions for future research and concludes that high-quality monitoring impact/process data, systematically and consistently collected, as well as innovative and inclusive evaluation methods are needed.},

	abstract = {Monitoring was carried out of particulate concentrations whilst simultaneously walking and driving 48 routes in London, {UK}. Monitoring was undertaken during May and June 2005. Route lengths ranged from 601 to 1351 m, and most routes were travelled in both directions. Individual journey times ranged from 1.5 to 15 min by car (average 3.7 min) and 7.3 to 30 min (average 12.8 min) whilst walking; car trips were therefore repeated up to 5 times for each single walking trip and the results averaged for the route. Car trips were made with windows closed and the ventilation system on a moderate setting. Results show that mean exposures while walking are greatly in excess of those while driving, by a factor 4.7 for the coarse particle mass ({PM}10–{PM}2.5), 2.2 for the fine particle mass ({PM}2.5–{PM}1), 1.9 for the very fine particle mass ({bPM}1) and 1.4 for ultrafine particle number density. The reduced in-car exposures appear to occur largely because the filtration system helps to prevent ingress of particles, so that the vehicle acts as a more-or-less independent micro-environment, insulated against much of air pollution present in the street. When account is also taken of the additional travel time involved in walking, these excesses are further increased: to factors of 15.6, 7.4, 6.5 and 4.4, respectively. Individuals who change their travel mode from car to walking in response to policies aimed at encouraging a modal shift in travel behavior are thus likely to experience considerably increased journey-time personal exposures to traffic-related air pollution. More effort is consequently needed to increase separation between road vehicles and pedestrians if negative effects of these policies are to be avoided.},

This is the history of how England’s elite came to own our land, and an inspiring manifesto for how to open up our countryside once more. This book has been a long time coming. Since 1086, in fact. For centuries, England’s elite have covered up how they got their hands on millions of acres of our land, by constructing walls, burying surveys and more recently, sheltering behind offshore shell companies. But with the dawn of digital mapping and the Freedom of Information Act, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for them to hide.Trespassing through tightly-guarded country estates, ecologically ravaged grouse moors and empty Mayfair mansions, writer and activist Guy Shrubsole has used these 21st century tools to uncover a wealth of never-before-seen information about the people who own our land, to create the most comprehensive map of land ownership in England that has ever been made public.From secret military islands to tunnels deep beneath London, Shrubsole unearths truths concealed since the Domesday Book about who is really in charge of this country – at a time when Brexit is meant to be returning sovereignty to the people. Melding history, politics and polemic, he vividly demonstrates how taking control of land ownership is key to tackling everything from the housing crisis to climate change – and even halting the erosion of our very democracy.It’s time to expose the truth about who owns England – and finally take back our green and pleasant land.},

This may in turn help normalise the image of cycling, and reduce perceptions that cycling is 'risky' or 'only for sporty people'. This paper sought to compare the use of specialist cycling clothing between users of the London bicycle sharing system ({LBSS}) and cyclists using personal bicycles. To do this, we observed 3594 people on bicycles at 35 randomly-selected locations across central and inner London. The 592 {LBSS} users were much less likely to wear helmets (16\% vs. 64\% among personal-bicycle cyclists), high-visibility clothes (11\% vs. 35\%) and sports clothes (2\% vs. 25\%). In total, 79\% of {LBSS} users wore none of these types of specialist cycling clothing, as compared to only 30\% of personal-bicycle cyclists. This was true of male and female {LBSS} cyclists alike (all p{\textgreater} 0.25 for interaction). We conclude that bicycle sharing systems may not only encourage cycling directly, by providing bicycles to rent, but also indirectly, by increasing the number and diversity of cycling 'role models' visible.

The location of bicycle share docking stations has been cited as a major barrier to uptake among lower socioeconomic groups. This study aimed to assess spatial access to bicycle share programs in Canadian cities by comparing the socioeconomic characteristics of dissemination areas inside and outside the bicycle share service areas. We obtained locations of bicycle share stations for the five existing programs in Canada: Vancouver, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Montréal. We used the material component of the Pampalon Deprivation Index (2011) as a measure of socioeconomic status for each dissemination area, calculating city-specific quintiles. We compared the distribution of deprivation for dissemination areas inside the bicycle share service area, compared with outside the service area. We found that advantaged areas have better access to bicycle share infrastructure in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Montréal, and conversely, that disadvantaged areas have better access in Hamilton. This analysis indicates that in most cities, substantial effort is needed to expand service areas to disadvantaged areas in order to increase spatial access for lower socioeconomic populations.},

The content includes a brief overview of history of bike share, current trend of bike share in the U.S., a case study of Divvybikes in Chicago, {IL}, and a brief introduction of spatial analysis process. A data analysis was then conducted on the demographic data of people living near Divvybikes stations in order to calculate the ratio of groups with different demographic characteristics who are more accessible to bike share. The ratio was used to determine if there is adverse impact on vulnerable groups based on The 80\% Rule. Several spatial analysis maps revealing spatial autocorrelation of equity and hotspots of inequity were created by calculating Moran’s I and Getis-ord Gi index. Finally, limitations and recommendations for the equity of bike share system accessibility are provided.},

The environmental and economic aspects of sustainability for bikesharing has been discussed extensively. While critical to overall success, the social equity aspect of bikeshare sustainability has been considered but not quantitatively assessed. This study finds that there is an inequitable distribution of bikeshare access among the population groups in {US} cities. This spatial analysis compares social and economic characteristics of {US} Census Bureau block groups based on the American Community Survey for areas within and outside of bikeshare service areas in seven cities. The locations of bikeshare stations were used to define the bikeshare service areas by creating a 500 meter buffer around each station in {ArcGIS}. Using a Student’s t-test to compare the means of socioeconomic characteristics inside and outside of the bikeshare service areas, significant differences in access based on race and income variables were found in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and New York City. Moreover, in Chicago, New York City, Denver, and Seattle, there was also a difference in the education level variables. The inequity in bikeshare access should be addressed by planning agencies and local governments. Corrective actions include public subsidies for stations in low income neighborhoods and educational resources.},

	abstract = {The recent proliferation of bike share schemes ({BSS}, also known as public bicycle use programs) in many cities has focused attention on their potential for reducing motorised traffic congestion, improving air quality and reducing car use. Since 2005, hundreds of bike share schemes have been implemented in many cities, with bike share usage patterns monitored in many of them. This paper assesses the development of {BSS} and provides a rationale for their potential health benefits. The key research question, as yet unanswered, is whether {BSS} themselves can contribute to improving population health, particularly through increasing population cycling, which would increase population levels of health-enhancing physical activity. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the contribution of {BSS} to population physical activity, and uses examples of new data analyses to indicate the challenges in answering this question. These illustrative analyses examine cycling in Australia, and [i] compares rates of cycling to work in {BSS} cities compared to the rest of Australia over time, and [ii] modelling trends in bike counts in Central Melbourne before and after introduction of the {BSS} in 2010, and compared to adjacent regions in nearby suburbs unexposed to a {BSS}. These indicative examples point to difficulties in attributing causal increases in cycling for transport to the introduction of a {BSS} alone. There is an evidence gap, and a need to identify opportunities to improve the health-related components of {BSS} evaluations, to answer the question whether they have any impact on population physical activity levels.},

Yet, the postcolonial era does represent some novelty: as was clear under the Conservative-led coalition and is now evident under a Conservative majority government, soft power is no longer exercised principally via cultural diplomacy, through, for example, the British Council, but increasingly via large companies which promote British economic and political interests through corporate imperialism.},

	shorttitle = {The public bicycle-sharing scheme in Brisbane, Australia},
	abstract = {Background
Active travel may improve individual health as it contributes to higher levels of physical activity, particularly in an aging society. Bicycle-sharing schemes may contribute to public health by encouraging active travel.
Aim
To investigate whether exposure to a bicycle-sharing scheme—measured as residential proximity to a bicycle station—was associated with the propensity to use it. Second, we aimed to study the extent to which exposure to the scheme was associated with a change in time spent cycling.
Method
In this natural-experimental study, we analysed a large panel of residents in Brisbane, Australia, who were surveyed before and after the introduction of a bicycle-sharing scheme in 2010. Data were collected as part of the {HABITAT} study, a multilevel longitudinal investigation of physical activity and health among ‘baby boomers’ (persons aged 40–65). Data were collected in 2009 (n = 7866), 2011 (n = 6900), and 2013 (n = 6520). Two self-reported outcome variables were examined: (1) a stages-of-change variable measuring the likelihood of using the scheme and the intention to use it in the future, and (2) change in time spent cycling between 2009 and 2013.
Results
In the unadjusted model, proximity was significantly associated with stages of change, but became non-significant after adjustment. Moreover, higher levels of exposure to the intervention did not predict a change in time spent cycling. Younger respondents and respondents with a higher education level were more likely to consider using the bicycle-sharing scheme. Individuals who had a college degree were more likely to have used this scheme.
Conclusion
Residential proximity to a bicycle-sharing station was not found to be associated with the use of the bicycle-sharing scheme nor did its introduction significantly predict an increase in time spent cycling. Other interventions may be more supportive of increasing cycling in the baby boomer cohort, and, thereby, improving their overall health.},

	abstract = {Shared bicycles provide a convenient mobility option to commuters especially for short-distance trips. Nevertheless, it also presents a challenge to bicycle-sharing operators as they have to deal with reallocation issues, i.e. removing bicycles from parking facilities which are at or near capacity and refilling parking facilities that are in need of bicycles. Few studies in the literature have actually tried understanding why certain docking stations are prone to excessive demand or suffer from a lack of parking supply. This paper attempts to identify the demographic, built-environment and transport-infrastructure indicators that can potentially aid policy-makers and operators in identifying parking facilities prone to bicycle reallocation. In particular, we have adopted the bicycle sharing operations in Nanjing, China as a case study to understand how such indicators can be identified for appropriate parking infrastructural enhancements. To achieve this goal, this study has established zero-inflated negative binomial models using multi-source data including point-of-interest ({POI}), daily weather, transit stop location, demographic data and bike-share smart card data. The model results obtained from this study suggest that built environment correlates significantly to shared bicycle reallocation count. In general, bicycle docking stations with large reallocation counts are more likely to be found near residences, bus stops, metro stations, employment areas, restaurants, amenities, parks, sports facilities, and clinics/hospitals; while stations near entertainment facilities, places of attraction, hotels, shopping malls, and educational institution tend to have balanced demand and supply. Analysis on the elasticity values revealed that mean temperature and station capacity are the most influential factors in bicycle reallocation. Among all {POIs}, presence of restaurants and areas with high employment tend to exhibit strongly a need for morning bicycle removal and evening bicycle refilling at docked stations. Policy makers can provide actual guidelines in the planning of shared bicycle parking facilities using the findings and methodologies presented in this study.},

Great Rides Bike Share launched with 11 stations and 101 bikes in 2015 in Fargo, North Dakota. This is one of the smaller systems in the United States, but it has been very successful. This study examines the ridership data for Great Rides Bike Share during its first two years of operations, investigates it keys to success, and estimates impacts of weather, temporal, and spatial variables on bike share use. In terms of trips per bike per day, bike share usage in Fargo surpasses that of the largest programs in the country. Keys to its success were the presence of a college campus and the reduced barriers to use for college students. The ridership model showed that temperatures, wind, precipitation, and the location of stations on a college campus all have significant impacts on bikes share use.},

	abstract = {As the number of bike share programs across the world has grown, studies of bike programs and operations have proliferated. Most empirical studies of bike share demand have included analyses of station use while a limited number of studies have investigated member behavior. Moreover, a limitation of this research is that the most research designs have been cross-sectional and therefore unable to establish causality. To address this limitation, we employ a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference modeling approach using a six-year panel data set of members’ bike share trips from 2010 to 2015 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. This research design takes advantage of changes in the bike share network over time to establish treatment and control groups and test the significance of effects of changes in accessibility on the frequency of individual member’s use of bike share. Improvements in accessibility are measured as a reduction in distance to stations resulting from placement of new stations or relocation of old stations. We find a significant negative impact of distance on the frequency of use and that the effects of increasing bike share accessibility are larger in areas with denser bike share services. Specifically, members for whom access improved (i.e., distance decreased) were significantly more likely to increase the frequency of use than members for whom access remained the same. Moreover, by developing different models, we show the effects of distance are heterogeneous and vary with different built environment contexts. Members who live in areas with higher population density and a higher percentage of retail land use tended to increase their bike share use more. Our results indicate that improvements in physical accessibility may not result in practically meaningful changes in the frequency of use in all cases and imply that multi-faceted strategies for increasing use may be needed.},

	abstract = {Background
Bike sharing systems have potential to substantially boost active transportation levels (and consequent physical and mental health) in urban populations. We explored equity of spatial access in a novel ‘dockless’ bike share system that does not that constrain bike pickup and drop-off locations to docking stations.
Methods
Starting in July 2017, Seattle, Washington piloted a dockless bike share system that made 10,000 bikes available. We merged data on resident sociodemographic and economic characteristics from the American Community Survey about 93 defined neighborhoods with data about bike locations, bike idle time, and which neighborhoods operators rebalanced bikes to. We used mapping and descriptive statistics to compare access between neighborhoods along sociodemographic and economic lines.
Results
With many bikes available, no neighborhood was consistently excluded from access. However, the average availability ranged from 3 bikes per day to 341 per day. Neighborhoods with more bikes had more college-educated residents (median 75\% college-educated vs. 65\%) and local community resources (median opportunity index score of 24 vs. 19), and higher incomes (median 83,202 vs. 71,296). Rebalancing destinations were strongly correlated with neighborhood demand (r = 0.61).
Conclusions
The overall scale of the dockless system ensured there was baseline access throughout Seattle. We observed modest inequities in access along sociodemographic lines, similar to prior findings in studies of docked bike share systems. Dockless bike share systems hold promise for offering equitable spatial access to bike sharing.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the usage of the London Cycle Hire ({LCH}). A total number of 707 {LCH} docking stations are included for a period of 36 weeks. Covariates such as socio-demographic characteristics, traffic conditions, and the built environment are included in the data set. A difference in difference ({DID}) based propensity score matching ({PSM}) method is applied to select control docking stations and estimate the effects of the dockless bike-sharing systems on the {LCH} usage. The results suggest that a significant reduction of 22.42 (5.93\%) in the average weekly usage of each {LCH} docking station is caused by the dockless bike-sharing system after its initial launch. We also investigate the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the characteristics of the {LCH} trips, including travel duration, travel distance, and departure time. The majority of trips replaced by the dockless bikes are short duration (0–15 min) and middle distance (1–3 km) trips. The reduction in the average weekly short duration trips of each station is 16.91 (7.16\%), while the figure is 15.11 (6.74\%) for middle distance trips. The average travel duration is increased by 0.25 min, but the travel distance shows no significant change due to data restriction. Furthermore, the {LCH} usage is significantly reduced by 6.85\% during the weekday commuting peak, and 10.47\% during the weekend leisure peak. As to weekday off-peak and other times, reductions are not statistically significant.},
