# Abstract {-}

Pro-cycling interventions, and cycle hire schemes in particular, are often assumed to primarily benefit the privileged.
This framing has played-out in academic research, with many papers exploring the relationship between cycling and existing inequalities.
A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend serve wealthy areas and young, high income groups, mirroring inequalities in other types of cycling uptake.
However, little research has explored whether such inequalities are growing over time.
<!-- and, more broadly, compared with usage of motorised modes. -->
<!-- This is an important omission given that the alternative to investment in cycle hire schemes may be investment in motorised transport systems, which could perform worse from an equity and environmental justice perspective. -->
Reflecting on the research and policy context, this paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), a large, early and prominent scheme that had the explicy aim of 'normalising' cycling.
The method involved analysis of 74 million cycle high records spanning 8 years from January 2012 to December 2020, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake.
<!-- Although the study does not compare equality impacts with other types of transport investment, it does take a step in this direction. -->
We found that, contrary to the trend for increasing segregation and geographic inequalities, the usage of the LCHS have become increasingly geographically distributed across London over time, with AM peak usage in comparatively low-income areas seeing high levels of growth.
Our study shows that cycle hire schemes can be designed and expanded in ways that benefit a wide range of people, including those from low income areas, and that new cycle hire docking stations in poorer areas can succeed.


<!-- # Paper -->

# Introduction

Since the turn of the 21^st^ Century, cycling has risen to prominence in transport plans worldwide.
Once perceived as an old fashioned mode, recent evidence on its ability to support pressing political priorities --- including air quality, congestion, liveable streets, and health/well-being --- has led to policies explicitly enabling cycling uptake in many cities including Beijing, New York, Santiago and London.

Bike share schemes (BSS) such as the LCHS aim to address two of the major barriers to cycling: lack of access to a working bike and the perception that cycling is only for certain (often young, male, high income) groups by providing 24/7 access to bikes at relatively low costs (compared with motorised modes, and driving a private automobile in particular) [@shaheen_bikesharing_2012], enabling a wide range of people to access the benefits of cycling [@goodman_role_2014].
BSSs are inevitably localised policies, enabling bikes to be rented at multiple docking stations located across (usually central) parts of cities, especially near major trip attractors, and the data they produce provides a rich source of information on how cycling levels are changing and shifting [@obrien_mining_2014].

Cycle hire is a rapidly evolving phenomenon.
The first schemes allowed the use of bicycles for free ('First generation'), or through a coin deposit ('Second generation'), which often resulted in problems of financing and theft.
The 'Third generation' schemes, to which the LCHS belongs, allow users to access and return bikes to dedicated docking stations, typically with only a bank card or other type of payment device, which makes the service more viable.
'Fourth generation' smart bikes with integrated locking technology can communicate with user smart phone apps, removing the need to communicate with a station or terminal, enabling journeys to start or end away from traditional docking stations.
This free-floating operational 'dockless' bikeshare model, can also run as a hybrid model composed of docking stations and free-floating parking zones shown on a map.
Globally, there has been an emergence of schemes funded primarily by private capital and with lower installation times, accounting for the majority of growth in bike share fleets worldwide since 2016 [@fishman_safety_2018].
Continued growth and the private capital led operations makes assessment of bikeshare important, to monitor their performance compared with other types of sustainable transport intervention, understand how bikeshare is used, where and by whom and to ensure that future cycle hire policies support, rather than hinder, local policy objectives.
While Fourth generation schemes have seen explosive growth in some areas, they have also suffered setback, including the high-profile collapse of dockless bike companies leading to questions about the sustainability of Fourth generation schemes [@nikitas_how_2019] and the docked bikes of the LCHS still dominate the local market, as shown in Section \@ref(the-london-cycle-hire-scheme).
<!-- The focus of CHSs are varied. -->
<!-- From a transport planning perspective, they are seen as a way to replace short journeys, otherwise made by congested taxi or metro systems, with active transport; from a health perspective they are a way to encourage a more active population; and from a political perspective, they often represent an opportunity to improve the image of the urban environment [@bauman_unrealised_2017]. -->

In this context the aim of this paper is to better understand the extent to which cycle hire schemes have been adopted by users from areas of differing socio-economic outcomes.
Using data from the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), first launched in 2010 and continuously expanded since, we explore usage patterns in high and low income areas.
After a review of literature on the growth of cycle hire from a social equity perspective, in the next section, the paper describes the LCHS in detail, outlines methods for comparing usage levels over time across geographic areas, and presents the findings.
We discuss the findings in relation to pressing policy and research questions and conclude with recommendations for transport policymakers and researchers.

# Background

<!-- This section discusses trends in bicycle sharing schemes, determinants of their uptake, and their levels of inclusiveness. -->
Bicycle sharing systems (BSS) have been created in many cities to support multiple policy objectives, especially improved health, air quality and liveability [@fishman_bikeshare:_2016].
Modern docked cycle hire schemes have been in operation since 1995, with the launch of a scheme in Copenhagen [@didonato_city-bike_2002].
They have taken off since the early 2000s, with the greatest absolute period of growth occurring between around 2010 and 2015, after which the rate of new installations has dropped off (Figure \@ref(fig:global-growth)).

```{r global-growth, fig.cap="Growth in docked cycle hire schemes worldwide in terms of docking stations by continent.", out.width="80%", fig.pos="h", eval=TRUE}
# file.edit("code/get-global-stations.R") # to reproduce this plot
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bikehshare-global-stations-growth.png")
```

European cities pioneered shared cycle mobility, with schemes in cities such as Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Rennes (France) demonstrating the concept's feasibility  [@didonato_city-bike_2002], and the number of European schemes has continued to grow.
Asia saw very rapid uptake of sharing schemes from 2010. Seven of the top ten largest schemes by number of docking stations and number of bicycle have been launched in Chinese cities between 2008 and 2011 (see Figure \@ref(fig:global-stations-cycles)).
North and South America have seen substantial interest in docked cycle hire schemes, although on a smaller scale than those in Europe and Asia, and a handful of cycle hire schemes have been launched in Australia.
Within this global overview, the London BSS is an important player, ranking eighth in the top schemes by number of docking stations and launching relatively early in 2010.

```

## Determinants of cycle hire scheme usage

### Who uses cycle hire schemes?

Much research has been devoted to the question of who uses BSS.
In general, reflecting cycle usage overall, BSS users appear to be younger adults, have higher incomes than average, male and are more likely to own a bicycle  [@ogilvie_inequalities_2012; @fishman_bike_2013; @zhao_effect_2019; @soltani_exploring_2019; @heinen_public_2018].
These socio-economic characteristics may seem <!--are--> similar to those that are generally linked to cycling [see e.g. @heinen_commuting_2010].
<!-- A survey by shared mobility organisation CoMoUK found that 21% of BSS users in the UK were on an income of less than £20,000, 9% on an income of less than £10,000, and less than 1% were unemployed.^[ -->
<!-- See https://como.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CoMoUK-Bike-Share-Survey-2019-web-2.pdf -->
<!-- ] -->
<!-- Whilst this hides variation depending on each scheme, it however highlights that low income users constitute a substantial share of overall BSS use. -->
<!-- Members of BSS have been found to be more likely to own and use private bicycles [@fishman_bike_2013]. -->

<!-- While the characteristics of BSS users and other cyclists may seem similar -->

However, some research reveals certain differences between cyclists using BSS and 'normal' cyclists that imply BSS can open up cycling to a wider range of users.
<!-- @buck_are_2013, for example, report that in Washington, D.C., BSS users are more likely to be female, younger, from lower (household) income backgrounds, and own fewer cars and bicycles than other cyclists. -->
Buck et al. [-@buck_are_2013, p.112] found in the Washington, D.C., region that, compared with regular cyclists, bike-share users "are more likely female, younger, have lower household incomes, own fewer cars and fewer bicycles, and are more likely to cycle for utilitarian trip purposes".
<!-- I don't think this next bit is that relevant -->
<!-- By contrast,  and Goodman (2012) showed that among members women made fewer trips and men.  -->


### Where are hired cycles used?

Research has focussed on where users ride, partly perhaps driven by an underlying question of where stations are best placed. BSS stations that are located in either a city centre and on a university campus are often well used [@mattson_bike_2017;@zhang_expanding_2016].
Other facilities have been shown to increase use of bicycle sharing stations, including proximity to housing, train and metro stations, bus stops, shops, parks, hospitals, and employment sites [@fishman_bike_2014; @bachand-marleau_better_2012; @buck_are_2013; @daddio_maximizing_2012; @wang_new_2019; @rixey_station-level_2013; @nair_large-scale_2013; @hampshire_analysis_2012; @fuller_use_2011; @zhao_effect_2019; @mooney_freedom_2019].
<!-- (Bachand-Marleau et al., 2012; Buck and Buehler, 2012, Daddio, 2012; Wang et al., 2016; Rixey, 2013; Nair et al., 2013; Hampshire and Marla, 2012; Fuller et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019). -->
<!-- Docking stations tending to be placed in areas of high transport demand [@de_chardon_bicycle_2017]. -->

Cycling organisations have advocated that BSS stations should be located not only on their potential use, but also on their potential to provide new mobility options to disadvantaged transport populations [@league_of_american_bicyclists_new_2015; @sustrans_our_2019].
In Boston, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and New York City (US), Aultman-Hall and Ursaki [-@ursaki_quantifying_2015] found significant differences in access based on race and income variables.
In Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio, Salvador and Sao Paulo (Brazil), Duran et al. [-@duran_bicycle-sharing_2018] found that the coverage of bicycle-sharing systems favoured wealthier and centrally located neighborhoods with higher proportion of white population.

## Bicycle sharing schemes, transport equity and social inclusion

<!-- Improving mobility and city liveability are often the primary objectives of CHS, but they have the potential to tackle or reinforce social inequalities. -->
<!-- ref? -->
BSS have the potential to enable a wider range of people to benefit from access to cycling for daily transport as it offers an affordable form of transport.
The LCHS costs £2 for making a potentially unlimited number of rides of less than 30 minutes over a 24 hour period of use, for example which is less than half the price of a typical single use metro (tube) ticket.^[
See https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles/what-you-pay and https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares for cycle hire and tube prices respectively.
]
However, the lowest rates, such as the £90 for an annual ticket bought online, may exclude those on low incomes.
Another benefit of accessing a bike through a BSS is that maintenance and storage are paid for by the operator. Bike theft represents another potential problem that can be mitigated by cycle hire schemes.
All these may be of greater importance in low income areas, where the barriers to buying, storing, repairing, and bike theft will likely be greater.
A study on barriers to bikeshare on traditionally under-served neighbourhoods in the US [@portland_state_university_breaking_2017 p.1] found that some of the most common barriers to bicycling cited by lower-income people of color were issues that bike share could address, such as: not having a bike or related gear (47%); not having a safe place to leave a bike where they need to go (36%); the expense of buying a bike or related gear (41%); and not having a safe place to store a bike at home (32%).
Inequalities related to BSS are directly linked to use and access, and the consequent benefits of accessibility -- health.
<!-- Not sure where this direct quotation ends? -->

As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, BSS tends to be associated with higher socio-economic groups and higher incomes.
However, the use of schemes is also dependent on other aspects of social disadvantage.
Transport for London [@tfl_santander_2016], for example, found that casual users generally have lower incomes than annual members, implying that users with higher incomes would make more use of economically beneficial long-term subscriptions.
Similarly, @ogilvie_inequalities_2012 reported that registered users of the London scheme were more likely living in socio-economically advantaged areas, indicating that they may also have higher disposable income.
Other studies indicated that users are most likely to be middle-class [@clark_bicycle_2016].
Interestingly, the use of the scheme among registered users of the LCHS has been found to be more common for individuals living in more deprived areas: they made more trips than individuals in wealthier areas according to @ogilvie_inequalities_2012, suggesting different dynamics than those identified in studies of American BSS.
A recent example in Glasgow also demonstrates that BSS can gain high uptake among disadvantaged groups, provided sufficient support.
The '[Bikes for All](https://www.nextbike.co.uk/en/news/nextbike-provides-bikes-for-all-as-scheme-celebrates-community/)' BSS scheme was supported by a parallel package of engagement activities and measures to overcome barriers (particularly financial barriers) to shared mobility faced by diverse groups including along ethnic, housing tenure and employment lines.
The results from follow-up research into the scheme's impact shows that providing additional support, in addition to simply putting shared bikes in low income areas, can ensure high uptake among a wide range of disadvantaged groups [@yates_bikes_2019].^[
The scheme attracted a diversity of demographics, 49% identified as Black or Minority Ethnicity (BME), 26% were seeking asylum, 28% were unemployed, 42% were women and 9% were homeless.

<!-- Next line repeats previous content. -->
<!-- Moreover, (registered) CHS users have been found to be more likely male (Ogilvie and Goodman, 2012; Clark and Curl, 2016) and more likely white (Clark and Curl (2016). -->
<!-- Both are known correlates of income. -->
<!-- Being unaware of BSS limits the possibility to use them. -->
<!-- Education has also been found to relate to awareness of BSS [@bernatchez_knowing_2015]. -->

Accessibility to and awareness of BSS is also not equally spread across the population.
Areas with no docking stations have been found to have lower levels of awareness of shared mobility as a transport option [@bernatchez_knowing_2015].
BSSs tend to be more easily accessible to higher socio-economic groups [e.g. @ricci_bike_2015] and one reason offered for this is that stations may not be placed in less economically advantaged areas.
@ogilvie_inequalities_2012 reported that registered users of the London scheme were more likely to live in socio-economically advantaged areas and areas with high cycling levels.
<!-- It is important to note that (other) bicycle infrastructure is often first placed in more affluent areas. -->
<!-- Demand for bicycle sharing is higher in areas with more bicycle infrastructure [@el-assi_effects_2017]. -->
<!-- Common sense suggests that proximity to docking stations increases usage, something that has been found in several studies [@fishman_factors_2015; @bernatchez_knowing_2015; @fuller_use_2011]. -->
<!-- However, a recent cohort study revealed that residential proximity does not significantly predict the likelihood of using a BSS, suggesting that placement of docking stations may not be a primary cause of inequalities in BSS usage [@heinen_public_2018]. -->

Overall, there is little evidence of the <!--overall--> transport equity outcomes from cycle hire schemes.
One recent paper on the role of cycle hire schemes in transport equity, stated that "most BSS typically benefit the privileged" [@de_chardon_contradictions_2019, p.401].
In the same direction, Noland [-@noland_bikesharing_2018, p.151] found in Philadelphia that "bikeshare docking stations in lower income areas are not generating as many trips as in other areas".
@hosford_who_2018 noted the importance of confounding geographic factors: economically advantaged areas have better access in some cities, whereas in other cities disadvantaged areas are better served.
<!-- And Mooney et al., (2019) suggest that modest inequities in access exist in Seattle by socio-demographic characteristics. -->

<!-- ## Cycle hire and equity -->

<!-- Cycle hire schemes have the potential to enable a wider range of people to benefit from access to cycling for daily transport, costing £2 per ride in London (less than a typical metro ticket) or £90 per year if you buy an annual ticket through an online form (a cost that will exclude many in low income areas from this option). TfL [@tfl_santander_2016] found that casual users generally have lower incomes than annual members. -->
<!-- ref? -->
<!-- The benefits of a shared scheme, where maintenance and storage are paid for by the operator, may be of greater importance in low income areas, where the barriers to buying, storing and repairing will be greater.

<!-- Bike theft in deprived areas represents another potential problem that can be mitigated by cycle hire schemes. -->
<!-- todo: verify -->
<!-- The evidence on the overall transport equity outcomes from cycle hire schemes is mixed. -->
<!-- One recent paper is scathing of the role of cycle hire schemes in transport equity, stating that "most BSS typically benefit the privileged" [@de_chardon_contradictions_2019]. In the same direction, Noland [-@noland_bikesharing_2018, p.15] found in Philadelphia that "bikeshare docking stations in lower income areas are not generating as many trips as in other areas". However, Buck et al. [-@buck_are_2013, p.112] found in the Washington, D.C., Region that, compared with regular cyclists, bike-sare users "are more likely female, younger, have lower household incomes, own fewer cars and fewer bicycles, and are more likely to cycle for utilitarian trip purposes". -->

# The London Cycle Hire Scheme

<!-- This section provides an overview of the LCHS. -->
With an urban population approaching 9 million, London is the largest city in Western Europe and, housing many the world's 'super rich', has substantial overseas links [@shrubsole_who_2019].
<!-- (including tram)Underground/DLRRail  -->
<!-- London plays an important role in the history of bikeshare worldwide, partly due to the political prominence of the UK's capital, and also because it was an early . -->
<!-- London is home to an estimated 93 billionaires, more than any other city . -->
In addition to economic and cultural influence associated with the super-rich (a driver of high living costs and economic inequalities), London's status as an international financial hub and cosmopolitan study and tourist destination boosts the city's 'soft power' [@bell_soft_2016].^[
Although Bell (2016) is focussed on the British influence, many of the paper's main points are particularly relevant to London.
In terms of tourism, London attracts ~30 million visitors each year according [London's Economic Plan](http://www.uncsbrp.org/tourism.htm).
]
On seeing and trying accessible cycling, some of London's diverse and generally wealthy visitors may go on to try cycling elsewhere.

Unlike other major high-income cities in the UK (and the world), the majority of trips in the UK's capital are made by 'sustainable' modes, with public transport, walking and cycling accounting for 35%, 24% and 2% of trips in 2016 respectively, although cars still account for around 35% of trips, according to London's [10](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=2ahUKEwjj6b6pldXlAhV5ShUIHRQZBYQQFjAEegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftfl.gov.uk%2Fcdn%2Fstatic%2Fcms%2Fdocuments%2Ftravel-in-london-report-10-data.xlsx&usg=AOvVaw3wFwZPyKmV86i71fCoa0Bo)s Travel report).
Cycling is the fastest growing mode of transport in London, with trip numbers more than doubling since 2000.^[
See https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/londons_cycling_infrastructure.pdf
]

LCHS has a direct impact on many London residents who have used the scheme since its 2010 launch (making London an early adopter).
It is large, boasting the second largest number of bikes of any system worldwide in 2014 [@fishman_bikeshare:_2016].
^[
There were nearly 10,000 bikes in the scheme at the time and there are around 11,500 now, although fewer are in circulation, docked or being used on the streets.
According to data from [bikesharemap.com](https://bikesharemap.com/london/#/12.384657071672539/-0.1195/51.5021/) there are around 8,000 cycles typically in circulation.
See https://madeby.tfl.gov.uk/2019/08/09/cycle-hire-trivia-and-facts/ for more cycle hire facts and figures.
]
The stated aim was to provide "a major new form of public transport in London, delivering an additional 40,000 cycle trips per day" [@transport_for_london_cycling_2010] (currently the scheme averages 30,000 hires per day over the year, around double the initial level of usage, with peaks over 45,000 trips on busy summer days).
Although the scheme currently delivers only around 0.1% of trips in Greater London overall, it serves a much higher percentage of trips in the congested central areas during the vital rush hours.
By providing a new form of transport targeting commuters, another important aim was to relieve peak capacity constraints on the tube and bus network^[
‘We want thousands of commuters to switch to bikes for the last stage of their journeys to work, significantly relieving pressure on the Tube and bus networks in central London.’ https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/cycling_vision_gla_template_final.pdf
]. It should be noted that in recent years new bikeshare operators have established themselves in London, many of which offering more flexible dockless usage. Whilst these schemes offer exciting opportunities for analysis -- many contain in-built GPS recording users' full journey trajectories -- the Santander scheme remains by far the largest and most widely used  \@ref(fig:cycle-hire-players).

There has been continued growth in usage of the scheme, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:cycle-hire-chart-daily).
The main features of the graph, which runs from the 30^th^ July 2010 to the 30^th^ September 2019, correspond to events in the history of the LCHS, including:

* LCHS launch in late July 2010, initially with 315 docking stations and 5,000 bikes.
* Expansion in March 2012 to 8,000 bikes and additional 570 stations, reflected in the rapid growth in early 2012 shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cycle-hire-chart-daily).
* Expansion in December 2013 West and Southwest
<!-- London ?? bikes and ?? docking stations, -->
corresponding with a step change in the annual average number of hires after 2014.

<!-- reference needed -->
What was not stated in such policy documents was precisely which social groups were expected to make greatest use of the scheme.
<!-- The two groups most associated with the scheme among non-cycling Londoners are, according to stereotype, probably *commuters*, who are typically male, white, young/middle-aged, professional with high-incomes (rather like Boris Johnson was during his term a Mayor) and *tourists* who are assumed to be casual users renting bikes for leisure and fun. -->
<!-- reference needed todo: uncomment above statement if we find a reference supporting it-->
<!-- The scheme also aimed to *diversify* cycling, however. -->
<!-- The idea was (and still largely is) that bikeshare would be a 'gateway drug', reaching people who would not normally cycle and getting them hooked. -->
Delivered as part of a package to "help 'normalise' the use of the bicycle as a transport mode in all situations and at any time, from commuting for work to a night out" [@greater_london_authority_mayors_2010], the LCHS was introduced at a time of massive investment in cycling.
The LCHS has continued to attract investment alongside funding for prominent schemes including Cycle Superhighways,
<!-- introduced[cite dates, locations], -->
numerous dedicated cycle lanes,
<!-- [cite dates, locations], -->
quietways
<!-- [cite dates, locations] -->
and 'mini Holland' residential interventions.
Despite cycle hire schemes being perceived as disproportionately benefiting  privileged groups, there is some evidence to suggest that the LCHS has indeed helped to normalise cycling.
@goodman_role_2014 found that the scheme has a higher proportion of women than those cycling in London overall (32% vs. 23%), and mentions data from the London Travel Demand Survey (LTDS) showing that low income groups tend make more journeys by foot and bus than underground, implying huge potential for bikeshare in low income areas.

The Santander Cycles customer survey [@tns_santander_2017], the sixth wave conducted since 2012, reveals that in 2017 the LCHS was primarily used by those who were male, young, white, and full-time workers. Regarding income, there were significant differences between casual users (which in 2017 represented 41% of all users) and member users. While casual users were from all income levels in similar proportions (except for a small greater proportion of those between £20k-£40k), members over-indexed amongst the high income ranges (see figure 4).

A question that has not yet been addressed, however, is has the LCHS *become more equal* over time?
Of course, this is a broad and to some extent subjective question because there are many ways to define 'equal'.
For the purposes of this study, we will focus on spatial inequalities and focus on income inequalities, using relative levels of use between small areas (Output Areas, with around 100 households each) with high and low income levels as a proxy for equity (limitations of this methodology are discussed in the penultimate section).
The research questions are:

> Since the LCHS scheme was expanded in 2014 -- 

* Has the geographic distribution of docking stations and usage become more equal?
* And has the uptake of use at docking stations in low income areas increased at a greater rate than for the scheme overall?


<!-- * Network of docking stations is reasonably dense -- neighbouring docking stations located no more than 300m from one another. -->
<!-- * Possible to make journeys between any pair of stations, but pricing structure encourages shorter journeys -- first 30 minutes are free. -->

<!-- ![](out.gif) -->

<!-- Content from intro, to be re-integrated: -->

<!-- * That scheme expanded into more residential, and sometimes deprived areas (eastern expansion into Tower Hamlets) - Roger. -->
<!-- * However, survey and other more observational data on *usage* demonstrates ...? Input from Chris/Antonia please. -->
<!-- * A paragraph + references from Eugeni on the relationship between overall cycling levels and cycling inequalities. -->

<!-- In the last two decades, the bicycle has been the mode of transport that has grown the most in London [@tfl_cycling_2018]. However, the demographic profile of bicycle users does not seem to have changed significantly during this period (need reference), which remains being mostly white, male, middle-aged, middle-income and high populations. This was supported by Aldred, Woodcock, and Goodman [-@aldred_does_2016] when comparing census 2001 and 2011 data in Inner London. -->

<!-- According to TfL [-@tfl_analysis_2017], only 27% of current cycle trips are made by women, and 15% by black, Asian and minority ethnic people (BAME) individuals. There is also evidence that people living in London’s deprived and poorer areas cycle less than the average [@tfl_travel_2015; @tfl_what_2011]. -->

<!-- * Scheme running almost 10 years, we try to infer whether or not bikeshare cycling might increasingly be more equal. [Need to clarify what we mean by this -- more whether scheme use is *diversifying*  -- spatial patterns of use especially -- and whether we see more activity that looks like journeys made by residents (both utility and leisure).] -->

<!-- * On saying more about this (what we do in the paper)...We: -->
<!-- 1. Consider equality of bikeshare infrastructure provision : Estimate residential catchment areas for bikeshare docking stations and characterise the socio-economic compositon of those catchment areas and how this has *changed* as the scheme's infrastructure has expanded. -->
<!-- 2. Condider equality of bikeshare usage given this provision : Comparing observed trip frequencies by docking station socioeconomic category and also *change* in these frequencies  over time. -->
<!-- 3. What else? -->


# Data and methods

<!-- The methods reflected the available datasets on the LCHS, which were large and messy. -->
We used the open source statistical environment R [@R-base] for data processing and analysis, making use of packages such as **sf** and **ggplot2** for geographic analysis and visualisation respectively [@pebesma_simple_2018; @ggplot2].
To ensure reproducibility and encourage others to build on the work we have done, by saving time spent on data cleaning, the code underlying the analysis presented in this paper has been made freely available for others to learn from and use (see [github.com/to-be-confirmed](https://github.com)). 
A detailed account of the input datasets and methods used to characterise shifting trip patterns are provided below.

[Note: this repository will be made available on publication.]

## Trip and docking station datasets

Data on docking stations was provided by the Consumer Data Research Centre ([data.cdrc.ac.uk](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/product/ffc94eb2-baf0-46f9-bf7d-5e8dd424b95d?accesslevel=open&q=&sort=title_string+asc)).
This was made available in a '.csv' file containing 1,130 rows with 19 variables including docking station ID, name, location coordinates and its opening date.
The other key dataset used in this study was Origin-Destination (OD) trip data, published by [Transport for London](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk) and accessed via the [bikedata](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) R package [@padgham_bikedata:_2017].
Both datasets were linked via a docking station ID.
In the _trips_ table, the origin and destination docking station and corresponding timestamps is recorded.
The _docking station_ table contains IDs, names and geographic coordinates for each docking station.
A script was developed to clean the raw data, remove duplicate trips and ensure that records omitted from the bikedata package (version `0.2.3`) were included in the analysis.
In total 73.4 million trips, with known start and end points, were recorded from January 2012 until the end of December 2019 (see Figure \@ref(fig:cycle-hire-chart-daily)).

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# trips_df = drake::readd(trips)

```


## Characterising residential users

To characterise the shifting spatial inequalities in the provision of bikeshare infrastructure in London, we joined residential zone data (at the LSOA level) to each docking station.
First we defined the study area as a polygon resulting from a 500 m buffer around the 'concave hull' of the docking stations.
<!-- --- the assumption here that 500m represents a reasonable maximum walking distance threshold from any residential area to a nearest docking station. -->
To estimate 'residential populations' who live in close proximity to docking stations, we developed a three-stage methodology involving: 1) estimating the average number of inhabitants per building, based on the smallest 'Output Area' population estimates and building footprint data from OpenStreetMap; 2) identifying residential buildings within a threshold distance (150 m was used) of docking stations; and 3) assigning the total estimated population in these buildings to their associated docking station (see Figure \@ref(fig:bikeshare-resi-buildings)).
 <!-- as this represents a maximum walking distance of around 300 m on the road network) -->

```{r bikeshare-resi-buildings, fig.cap="Method for estimating the residential population with access to docking stations within 150m. Blue shade represents the population in each Output Area, buildings are in green and buildings near docking stations are in red.", out.width="70%", eval=TRUE}
# file.edit("stations-classification.Rmd") # to reproduce
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bikeshare-resi-buildings.png")
```

Official population data from the 2011 Census were collected at Output Area and 2015 estimates of the Index of Multiple Deprivation and income deciles at the LSOA level.^[
See https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/4d3a8738-38af-401c-8070-6be5d85b2f5e
]
<!-- After attaching LSOA-level IMD decile scores to the OA data, docking stations were allocated to OAs using a straight-line distance measure.  -->
<!-- Here we used a slightly more conservative threshold of 300m distance between the docking station and OA population-weighted centroid. -->
<!-- The stations were found to have a wide distribution of scores, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:imd-scores-stations). -->
<!-- Yes so we need a plot that quickly shows frequency of stations by IMD decile -- perhaps compared against some expectation, for example frequencies of OAs within the scheme boundary by IMD decile? -->
<!-- TfL used this same assumption when designing the LCHS -- that is, within the network of docking stations no single docking station should be located more than 300 to 500 m from another docking station.^[ -->
<!-- See http://content.tfl.gov.uk/developer-guidance-for-santander-cycles.pdf -->
<!-- ] -->


## Identifying residential trips

<!-- * Data analysis challenge: that we want to make claims about bikeshare trips made by London residents, but the dominant usage scenario is of commuters from outside London using the bikeshare scheme to complete the `last mile problem' or of tourists using the scheme to make circular/leisure trips around the Southbank, Hyde Park, Regent's Park [reference for this] -->
<!-- @Robin at one point we allocated docking stations into residential/non-residential based on some data-driven characteristics (comparing observed trip frequencies against residential catchment size). Alternatively we could filter out hub stations (Waterloo, Stonecutter, Belgrove Street, King's Cross), or through calculating trip frequencies by docking station and exclude top n? Did we end up dropping this bit? I know that we filter on *origin* stations during the am peak, but I think some discussion of this, the data analysis challenge given the freely available dataset our analysis use case (and the fact that we do not have user IDs against which we can infer area of residence) -->

Since users' home locations and trip purpose are not stored in the OD data, it is impossible to know which trips were made by local residents and which were not.
However, it is possible to make speculative inferences around residential usage from trip patterns.
The daily flow of cycle hire scheme usage shows a clear pattern, with the majority of 'home station trips' (in which bikes are rented near the user's home) happening in the morning peak (which we define as 06:00 to 10:00).
The comparison between morning and afternoon usage patterns highlights the reasons for this emphasis: in the afternoon peak (16:00 to 20:00) many trips represent people renting cycles in the centre for the return leg of their journey and many more tourist and leisure trips are taken by non-residents during this time (see Figure \@ref(fig:map-am-pm-peaks)).

# Results


## Change in areas served by docking stations

The evolving spatial distribution of the LCHS is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:facet-map) (top), which shows that its expansion into residential areas corresponded with a shift towards lower income communities.
The map illustrates that the scheme has not expanded uniformly, with Phase 2 expanding into Tower Hamlets, to the East of the scheme and Phase 3 into areas south of the river such as Wandsworth and Clapham Junction in Southwest central London.
It seems that particular areas such as the area to the east of Hackney in the far north-east of the plot, and the cluster of docking stations going to Brixton in the central south region of the map, were targeted deliberately.
It is interesting to note that these demographically diverse geographic outliers were selected instead of more geographically central areas such as Bermondsey (on the South bank of the River Thames to the East), leading to the 'why the gap' campaign for the scheme to be expanded into this part of the city.^[
See [whythegap.london](http://whythegap.london) for the campaign for "Cycle Hire Scheme for Rotherhithe and Bermondsey", which contains quotes from many people on the importance of expanding the scheme, including London Mayor Sadiq Kahn who is quoted as saying:
"There are lots of anomalies in that cycle hire scheme. We are going to explore them."
]

```{r facet-map, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Changes in the spatial and social distribution of docking stations over time, 2010-2019, showing four stages of expansion.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:facet-map) (bottom) shows the percentage of docking stations associated with each income decile for each of the four years plotted in map above (2010, 2012, 2014, 2019).
This clearly shows that the provision of bikeshare opportunities in income areas has increased year-on-year, becoming more representative of London overall, in terms of income deciles of LSOA zones (the proportion of zones in each income decile is repeated in grey).
Overall, the average income decile associated with docking stations has dropped from 5.7 to 4.9 since the scheme's inception and the standard deviation has increased slightly from 2.87 income deciles to 2.94.
The question remains whether this increased provision of docking stations in low income areas also coincided with increased used in those areas?

<!-- Be good to compare this to the distribution for London as a whole -- e.g. how representative provision is of the London  population? It looks like, if anything, the distribution is becoming *less* diverse -- more polarised around very low and high deprivation. However, I suspect this may be more reflective of how LSOAs distribute in London on IMD -- in which case the argument that the provision is become more *representative* of London's socio-economic geography can be made in a compelling way. -->

## Income distribution of docking station usage

The relationship between docking station usage and levels of income deprivation at trip origins varies by time of day.
During the morning peak trips originating in more residential areas container comparatively high income deprivation (excluding stations by major transport hubs) are more common, per local resident per year.
In the PM peak, docking stations serving low income deprivation areas have more traffic as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:income-decile-am-pm-beeswarm), a boxplot that shows median levels of usage for morning (top) and afternoon (bottom) rush hours (not influenced by major docking stations serving large transport hubs).
This can partly be explained by the social-spatial geography of disadvantage in London, which tends not to cluster in central places that employ many people.
In the morning peak there is a mass movement of people from residential areas containing income deprivation into the city centre for work, a pattern that reverses in the afternoon.
The spatial distribution of the morning peak origins is likely to reflect the home location of BSS users better than the evening peak.
Based on this measure, the scheme seems to be relatively inclusive, with similar median levels of usage across all income deciles except for docking stations in zones with an income decile of 4 (mid-level income deprivation) which have high levels of usage per resident person per year and docking stations in zones with an income decile of 7 (comparatively lower income deprivation), which are associated with relatively low levels of usage.
But how has usage changed over time?

<!-- So I think these become a little challenging to interpret due to the dominant non-London commuter and tourist users -- the fact that a very large share of trips are made by non-residents. For this reason the residential/non-residential station allocation may be instructive, certainly the am-peak-time focus is good. However, I wonder whether we should be doing change-over-time comparison on these. E.g. are there changes to the relative number of trips originating from more/less deprived stations? -- it would be similar to the small multiple plot by IMD, but separate line for each docking station
I think it's worth exploring how this changes over time, but maybe one for after the reviewer's comments

## Changes in usage over time

Contrary to expectations, cycle hire usage does not seem to be lower in low income areas.
But is this a recent trend?
Figure \@ref(fig:change-time-income) explores this by showing the number of trips starting at docking stations associated with each income decile (again with 1 and 10 being the most and least income-deprived deciles respectively) over time.
These are daily counts smoothed over a 365-day period and, in order to compare within each income decile category, a local scaling is used per income decile.
Changes in counts for all docking stations in that income decile is coloured red; the thin grey lines are counts by individual docking stations with a local scaling per docking station, again to support relative comparison.
The addition of individual-level docking station data gives an indication of how representative the overall trend (in red) is across individual docking stations. In Figure \@ref(fig:change-time-boroughs) the same encoding is used, but docking stations are grouped by London borough and arranged according to their approximate spatial position. It should be noted that direct comparison of the overall and station-level trends (grey and red lines) should be treated with caution as the change in overall counts (red) is partly a function of scheme expansion  -- a corollary of more docking stations in certain boroughs or income deciles is, presumably, elevated trip counts in those areas.
<!-- Is this term right roger? -->

The patterns implied by these charts are instructive. Docking stations in central and "prime" London and where the scheme is typically at capacity -- Westminster and City of London and with many in income decile 10 -- show consistently high frequencies throughout the study period. There is strong pattern of increasing usage in parts of London associated with the western expansion (Hammersmith & Fulham, Wandsworth and parts of Lambeth) and to a lesser extent eastern expansion (Tower Hamlets and parts of Hackney). Particularly striking is the consistently increasing trip frequencies in Wandsworth and also further east in Lambeth and Southwark. These boroughs containing large working populations on the edge, or outside of, "prime" London, have recently benefited from new cycle infrastructure -- cycle superhighways often with segregated cycle lanes, completed between 2016 and 2018. That we see large relative increases in trip frequencies for docking stations in these boroughs perhaps suggests a more utilitarian and residential usage characteristic than the dominant stereotype for the LCHS of the rail commuter making regular peak-time journeys between hub stations or the tourist making occasional leisure journeys in London's parks.

<!-- This shows a mixed pattern, with growth in the diverse Hackney and Camden boroughs and steady or falling levels in the wealthy central and Westminster boroughs.
Tower Hamlets, a borough with many low income areas, saw steady levels of use over time. -->


<!-- The result, presented in Figure \@ref(fig:change-time-income) provides no evidence that the cycle hire scheme is becoming more unequal.
By contrast, Figure \@ref(fig:change-time-income) suggests that levels of resident usage have increased *more* in low income areas than in wealthy areas in absolute and relative terms.
The increases in AM peak-time trips starting at docking stations located in the lowest income areas in 2014 and 2015 can be explained by the eastern expansion of the scheme.
Continued gradual increases from 2016 to 2018 can be seen from docking stations associated with income deciles 1 to 4.
More gradual increases are visible in mid-to-high income areas (5th to 8th income deciles); the docking stations associated with the wealthiest areas (in close proximity to zones in the 10th income decile) shows relatively little change. -->

<!-- [I wonder whether time series analysis has summary statistics that we can use to describe *amount* of seasonality and *daily* variability. Generating these for each borough and IMD level might be instructive in allowing us to make claims about usage characteristics -- especially if we were able to calculate these using a moving window and show change over time. I tried to do this already mind with the trip typology analysis and this wasn't particularly illuminating.] -->

Figure \@ref(fig:trip-types-boroughs) shows the temporal trend by time of week: weekday morning (between 0600-1000), weekday evening (between 1600-2100), weekday interpeaks (between 1000-1600), night-time trips (between 2100-0600) and weekend daytime trips (between 0600-2100). Evenings are the dominant trip type for docking stations in job-rich high income boroughs such as City of London and, to a lesser extent, Westminster, Islington, Camden and Southwark.
For docking stations located in boroughs towards the edge of "prime" London, morning trips dominate.
This can be largely explained by commuting behaviour.
<!-- This is consistent with the domi -- rail commuters using the scheme to solve the so-called last mile problem. -->
However, an increasing pattern of morning peak-time journeys is present for boroughs that contain large resident populations and that are not located at a major rail hub (docking stations in Wandsworth and Hackney), suggesting that the use of the LCHS by resident commuters is increasing.
Furthermore, docking stations in these and non-central London boroughs (Kingston, Hammersmith and Tower Hamlets) are associated with large and increasing numbers of weekend trips, suggesting that use of the scheme for _leisure_ trips may not merely be the preserve of tourists.

# Discussion

<!-- ## Principal findings -->

We found evidence of continued growth in bikeshare usage, including in docking stations located in residential and low income areas, suggesting that the popularity of the LCHS is due to its utility:
the 'novelty effect' [@mattson_bike_2017] will have worn off after the first few years (although there could be a residual novelty effect for new docking stations).
The expansion of the LCHS into new areas made the provision of shared mobility more representative of the socio-economic distribution of London as a whole than when the scheme started in wealthier central area, providing an opportunity to test the hypothesis that cycle hire use would be lower in the relatively low income areas, as reported by @noland_bikesharing_2018, for example.
Contrary to research from the USA, we found that usage of bikeshare in London was relatively balanced across areas, independent of levels of income deprivation.

Time series plots disaggregated by income decile and geographic location reveal that much of the growth in the usage of the scheme since the expansion into more residential areas has come from relatively low income areas.
The _relatively_ higher income deprivation boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark have, for example, experienced high rates of growth compared with areas in Westminster and Kensington, especially during the morning rush hour when users are most likely to be local residents.
<!-- ## Research limitations -->
The conclusion that we take from the research (expanded on in the next section) is that shared mobility policies, and BSS in particular, can succeed in low income areas.

There are some limitations to the study that should be considered before attempting to generalise the findings, however.
The first limitation relates to the level of analysis: although the geographic resolution of analysis was relatively high (each LSOA zone contains less than 2000 people), the study lacks demographic data at level of individual bikeshare users.
We know very little about the income (and other) characteristics of users *compared with the demographic profile of their local area*, raising the following question:
Could the high rates of growth in low income areas reflect the behaviour of more affluent people (e.g. 'hipsters') living in low income areas?

Answers to such questions are outside the scope of this paper.
However, given the consistency of growth in a range of low income areas and considering the finances (£2 for 24 hour bikeshare access vs £4.80+ for a single tube ticket), our hypothesis is that future research will find that people on low incomes *are* using the LCHS and other BSS where provision is evenly distributed geographically, and fairly priced.
Figure \@ref(fig:profile-users-lchs) shows that although the income profile of casual users is relatively flat, LCHS members tend to be relatively wealthy, with the majority falling into the £75k+ income category.
Follow-on research could explore the extent to which growth in cycle usage in relatively low income areas is driven by wealthy new members or casual users on low incomes.
Furthermore, although the analysis uses small areas as the basis of the analysis, it is possible that 'micro-segregation' [@keddie_market_2010], where high income and low income households live streets apart, could in part explain the results, further strengthening the need for follow-up studies based on individual-level surveys.
<!-- In a city like London, the areas that delimit socioeconomic differences are usually smaller (than in America or Australia), and often crossing a street you can go from one extreme to the other. -->

Methodological advances could also help address the limitations outlined above, suggesting further work to support the generalisation of methods to estimate levels of provision and growth in cycle hire in relatively high and low income areas across different cities.
Although income estimates are rarely available for small areas in cities internationally, new methods for estimating wealth and deprivation [@jean_combining_2016] could support further international comparative research into inequalities in cycle hire schemes.
Finally, there is great potential for further technical and software development work, to make cycle hire research more accessible and reproducible.
Building on the the **bikedata** R package, future work could develop tools that automate tedious parts of the analysis, allowing future research to focus on the policy issues rather than the time-consuming yet vital data cleaning and analysis stages in cycle hire research.

# Conclusion

Overall, we find little evidence to support the view, articulated by @de_chardon_contradictions_2019, that cycle hire schemes are detrimental to transport equity and inclusiveness.
By contrast, in the case of London, the analysis presented in this paper finds that cycle hire *can* enable sustainable transport alternatives to a wide range of people, potentially reducing geographic transport inequalities.
The extent to which these findings will extend to individual-level analysis of bikeshare users, and to other cities, cannot be answered in this paper.
Recent findings suggests that supplementing policies providing access to shared bikes with *additional support measures* such as cycle training and subsidies for certain groups can help ensure that BSS benefits a broader range of people, including disadvantaged groups [@yates_bikes_2019].
This raises a wider question: can participation policies help address wider vandalism and stigma issues that can plague BSS, by showing that it is not just for "white, middle-class men"?

To return to the question in the title of the paper: yes, it seems that the London Cycle Hire Scheme is becoming more inclusive over time, at least in terms of the income distribution of provision and usage based on spatial analysis at high spatial and temporal resolution.
Given the stigma around cycling for some low income groups [@portland_state_university_breaking_2017] this should be seen as a major achievement.
The findings support the expansion of bikeshare into more low income and diverse communities.

However, the research presented in this paper also opens up wider questions.
Is usage of cycle hire becoming more equally distributed across other cities, or is London an exception?
How do inequalities of uptake in cycling compare with inequalities of uptake in car use?
And what role can active transport play in creating transport systems that are accessible to everyone?
Regardless of the answers to these emerging questions, the paper provides a counterpoint to the notion that cycle hire schemes only benefit affluent areas and their populations, and suggests that interventions to expand access into poorer areas of major cities can work.

<!--  Aims and Scope: -->

<!-- The global landscape of urban transport is changing rapidly, with cities worldwide adopting bicycle-sharing schemes. Besides the typical benefits, bicycle-sharing schemes offer the potential to provide alternatives for those marginalised by private car-based mobility or unaffordable transport costs. However, some existing evidence suggests that users of public bicycle-sharing schemes, like cyclists in general, tend to have higher incomes, high levels of formal education, and be disproportionately white, middle aged and male. -->

<!-- We are looking for research that interrogates how this emerging form of mobility includes or excludes different social groups in different global contexts. There has been burgeoning interest in bicycle-sharing in the academic literature over recent years, but the social inclusiveness of bicycle-sharing has been relatively understudied, with the literature instead focused on technical operational aspects or economic and environmental impacts. -->

<!-- Given the growth of bicycle-sharing schemes globally, including the most recent phenomenon of the dockless schemes, a critical overview of the impact of these services across different urban, physical and social environments is timely. High quality, internationally relevant evaluation of the equity and justice impacts of bicycle-sharing schemes is crucial to support policy makers realize how these services can be made accessible to as many and as diverse populations as possible. -->

<!-- We welcome papers including, but not limited to the following topics: -->

<!-- · Empirical papers concerning socio-spatial inequalities, justice, power relations and inclusivity of bicycle-sharing -->

<!-- · Evaluation of the access and use of bicycle-share among those likely to be excluded in transport or with additional mobility needs, such as older people, migrants and refugees, women, disabled people, lower income groups, LGBTIQ people, and minority ethnic groups. -->

<!-- · Approaches to and analyses of inclusive urban transport policies relating to bicycle-sharing -->

<!-- ## Hypotheses (to be hidden and discussed/disproven)

Cycle hire schemes are more equal than other modes in terms of the spatial and temporal distribution of users
By connecting high and low income areas, they reduce spatial inequalities
Over time the proportion of trips emanating from stations near low income areas has risen, suggesting growing acceptance among deprived groups -->

<!-- ## Research questions (to be hidden) -->

<!-- ### Questions that can be answered with data -->

<!-- - Within the cycle hire scheme's bounds, do stations tend to cluster around wealthy areas? -->
<!-- - Can we classify stations of origin on a scale from high to low income, e.g. in terms of proximity to residential areas? -->
<!-- - Can we classify stations of destination on a scale from high to low income? -->
<!-- - Is there a tendency for stations located near low income residential areas to be used less at certain times? -->
<!-- - Have 'low-income' stations-of-origin declined in popularity over time relative to 'high-income' stations of origin? -->
<!-- - Is there evidence that the new cycle superhighways led to greater use of 'low income' stations? -->
<!-- - Has the proportion of trips made during commute hours risen or declined over time? -->
<!-- - Has the proportion of trips seemingly made for tourism risen or declined over time? -->

<!-- ### Questions from Eugeni -->

<!-- - Does access to Santander’s sharing system in terms of deprivation equals usage? Who is the system actually serving? -->
<!-- - Does Santander’s bike sharing system contribute to reduce problems of transport-related social exclusion? Is there a correlation between the Santander’s stations usage and the levels of bike-ownership, car ownership +++ or/and public transport supply at certain times? -->
<!-- - Are the main low-income population destinations provided with Santander’s stations (e.g. locations where low-income population tend to work)? Equity analysis tend to focus on residence, but not on destinations (See Barajas, 2017). -->
<!-- - Do Santander’s stations have similar access to cycling infrastructure and/or public transport stations in deprived areas than in non-deprived areas? -->
<!-- - Is there any association between the size of houses (storage potential) and bike sharing usage? Any association with crime? -->

<!-- ### Questions that cannot be answered with the data alone (from Eugeni - this could be a separate paper led by Eugeni) -->

<!-- - Is there any specific system more inclusive than others? In London you can find different bike sharing systems: Santander, oBike, ofo, OYbike, Brompton Bike Hire, etc. Are dock less systems more or less inclusive than dock stations system? -->
<!-- - Are people riding bikes from or to deprived areas deprived population or ‘alternative’ wealthy people living or going there? -->
<!-- - Are the system prices reasonable for low-income populations? Are systems of payment and information about the systems equally accessible to everyone? Is the quality of the system (bicycles availability in stations, space to return bicycles, etc.) similar in deprived than in non-deprived neighbourhoods? -->

<!-- ### Wider boundary questions -->

<!-- - By enabling high income and low income residents to use the same networks, has the scheme reduce spatial inequalities on the roads? -->
<!-- - By encouraging wealthy people to cycle, do the schemes encourage political action to enable low cost and accessible transport? -->


<!-- ## Analysis plan -->

<!-- ### Measuring equality of provision and use -->

<!-- #### Equality of provision at "origin" -->

<!-- *Residential* catchment-area analysis of bikeshare docking stations: -->

<!-- 1. **Define catchment**. Generate a convex hull around docking stations -- include 500m? walking-distance buffer on this. All OAs containing ??% of their geographic area that lie within this buffer could be treated as *within catchment*. -->
<!-- 2. **Estimate access -- OAs**. Summarise docking stations over output areas: num docking station points per output area -- weight docking station points according to distance from population- weighted centroids (maybe introduce a floor so this weighting only kicks in after docking station is >300/500m from centroid). Once generated, plot these scores by OA and facet OAs by deprivation decile. -->
<!-- 3. **Estimate access -- stations**. Summarise population over docking stations: Generate a Hansen accessibility index for each docking station. Population counts weighted by distance from Output Area for each docking station and divided by docking station size (number of dockng points). Again, would want to consider introducing a floor here so weighting kicks in only after OA centroid is >300m from docking station. Also some density-based correction here as accessibility scores will not be reliable where there is spatial clustering in docking stations. So, for each docking station we create a walking-distance buffer of c.300/500m and sum all docking station points within that buffer. We then divide the population-weighted estimates per docking station by this number of docking points. -->

<!-- What do we expect to see from this? -->

<!-- * Might make sense to separate very central from less central OAs as there will most likely be a bi-modal dostribution in accessibility scores, even within bikeshare catchment on this. -->
<!-- * After this -- taking out central boroughs -- we would hope to see a reasonably even distribution of accessibility across London and by IMD decile. -->


<!-- #### Equality of usage at "origin", given provision -->

<!-- 1. **Estimate over/under use given residential catchment**. For each OA and/or each docking station we could generate an average count of daily hires (aggregated over 12-month period) per OA and per docking station and divide this number by our accessibility scores -- this would then allow us to judge differences in trip volumes by OA and station normalised by *residents*. Again, this might need careful thought as we'll have massive skew on this distribution of scores given the hub and central London docking stations. -->
<!-- 2.  **Estimate over/under use over time**. We could generate year-on-year summaries of this stat and explore how this changes over time. Maybe we could calculate some Entropy measure as a summary statistic of convergence/inequality? -->
<!-- 3. **Temporal usage profile for docking stations and OAs**. Plenty examples of using sumarising docking station profile as a vector of time bins (weekday am peak,weekday pm peak, night, weekend day) and running clustering algorithms to classify stations. Could do this at a station-level as well and see how this distributes -- though again dominant pattern of central, central periphery and residential will be main signal -- so maybe running this on *residential* locations only might work. Doing so might enable us to explore whether there is different level of commuter/utility/leisure between residential areas that are more/less deprived. -->

<!-- #### Equality of provision at "destination" -->

<!-- 1. **Estimate workplace access -- OA/station-level**. I wonder whether we could do the same given the workplace geography data from the Census. Here we would weight docking stations according to access to jobs -- both at the docking station and OA-level, but group by occupation-type to compare accessibility by occupation-type. -->

<!-- What would this show? I imagine massive competition, and so a lack of provision, in job-rich OAs and over-provision in job-poor areas (so maybe not that useful). But more interesting when comparing by occupation type -- e.g. the share of professional versus elementary jobs that are supported by the scheme infrastructure. -->

<!-- Additional note : Considering full provision of jobs on London using known ODs here might be good -- as working residents need to be connected with jobs. We have Census origin-destination data by LSOA and occupations, so we could look at these and calculate, across the whole of London jobs, the share of full OD that could reasonably be supported by bikeshare infrastructure -- and do this separately by occupation. -->

<!-- #### Equality of usage at "destination", given provision -->

<!-- 1. **Estimate over/under use given workplace catchment**. For each OA/LSOA and/or each docking station average count of daily hires (destination in am, origin in pm aggregated over 12-month period) per OA/LSOA and per docking station and divide this number by the workplace accessibility scores -- this would then allow us to judge differences in trip volumes by OA/LSOA and station normalised by *jobs*. Again, this would have a massive City of London skew. However, studying change over time in this might be interesting -- as scheme matures, do we see a more varied pattern of commuting travel? -->

<!-- ### Measuring change in use -->

<!-- #### What type of change might suggest greater equity? -->

<!-- Some existing evidence/theory -->

<!-- * @goodman_inequalities_2014 cite survey data identifying women consistuting a higher share of casual users. -->
<!-- * If the usage types look more *casual* (less utility, more leisure), might that suggest greater equity(we know women associated more with leisure cycling)? Possibly, but separating tourist from London-resident user problematic.  (@goodman_inequalities_2014  notes that among registered members non-resident in London 2% of all trips start in London's parks; this value is 15% for casual users; figure for London-resident members not cited). -->


<!-- So, maybe we want to label trips according to their function and then study whether these trip types are changing over time. Trip types: -->

<!-- * Casual / Member -- check whether have this as a variable? -->
<!-- * Trip labelling based on spatio-temporal signature -- proposed taxonomyy: -->
<!-- * * weekday am/pm peak ~ commute -->
<!-- * * night ~ social utility -->
<!-- * * weekend day (non park/circular) ~ social sustainability -->
<!-- * * day park ~ leisure and tourist -->

<!-- We could explore change in the relative number of these year-on-year, but also by IMD of origin|destination? -->
